1)  branches must have survey data in Jan.1999 
2a) longest survey length  (Use 12MCD10K to calculate the survey length), note that IRA rate length won't be used for branch selection.
2b) if there are more than one branch (of each bank) share the same survey length, pick the one without acquisition
3)  the last tie-breaker is branch deposit (keep the branch with the largest deposit)
